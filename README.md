# JobWave
[Back-End server here](https://github.com/gnieb/jobwave-server)

## About
This application was originally developed to help me get a job at a company I REALLY wanted to work for, but they didn't have the jobs posted that fit my qualifications. 
**Enter JobWave.**


### What's happening next?

- replace SVG with a small wave
- JOBS page using the backend scraper ([IN PROGRESS](https://github.com/gnieb/jobwave-server) )
- pick a color scheme
- implement default theme via CSS config
- connect the front end to the back end server
- deploy!!
